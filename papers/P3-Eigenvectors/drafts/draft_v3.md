### **Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues in Scientific Sonification: Complex Physical Systems as Musical Instruments**

**Author:** Daniel Sandner

**Abstract:**
We present a methodology for sound synthesis and processing based on the eigen-decomposition of parameterized linear systems. This approach treats abstract physical models, described by a system matrix H, as digital musical instruments. The system's eigenvalues determine resonant frequencies; eigenvectors define the modal basis for timbre and dynamics. We detail both an exact computational method and a real-time heuristic implementation in the web application `eigensound`. We extend this framework to audio processing through "Eigen-Filtering," where signals are transformed via projection onto a physical system's eigen-basis. This enables modal quantization and physically-modeled cross-synthesis. The framework provides scientists with an auditory tool for exploring system dynamics and offers artists physically-motivated controls for sound design.

#### **1. Introduction**

**1.1. The Auditory Modality in Scientific Analysis**

Scientific data analysis traditionally relies on visual representations. However, the human auditory system processes temporal patterns and multi-dimensional relationships through different neural pathways than vision, potentially revealing features obscured in visual displays. Sonification—the use of non-speech audio to convey information—leverages these complementary perceptual capabilities (Kramer et al., 1999). The auditory system's temporal resolution exceeds that of vision by an order of magnitude, making it particularly suited for detecting transient events and rhythmic patterns in time-series data (Neuhoff, 2004).

**1.2. From Parameter Mapping to System Sonification**

Early sonification techniques employed direct parameter mapping, where data values control acoustic parameters (Hermann, 2002). Model-based sonification advanced this by rendering the output of dynamic simulations (Hermann & Ritter, 1999). Physical modeling synthesis successfully simulates acoustic instruments through mathematical models of their mechanics (Smith, 1992; Cook, 2002). This paper generalizes physical modeling beyond acoustic systems to sonify any linear operator representable as a matrix.

**1.3. The Eigenspectrum as System Identity**

We propose that a system's eigenspectrum constitutes its fundamental acoustic signature. In quantum mechanics, the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation, Ĥψ = Eψ, exemplifies this principle: the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues are the observable energy levels, and transitions between eigenstates produce measurable frequencies. By extension, any linear system's eigen-decomposition reveals its natural oscillatory modes. For non-linear systems like those in General Relativity, we sonify linearized approximations—a standard technique in perturbation theory (Weinberg, 1972).

**1.4. Contributions**

This paper presents: (1) A formal framework linking eigen-decomposition to modal synthesis parameters; (2) "Eigen-Filtering," an audio processing technique based on projection onto system eigenbases; (3) A real-time implementation demonstrating practical feasibility; (4) Analysis of scientific and artistic applications.

#### **2. Mathematical Framework**

**2.1. System Representation**

We model system dynamics through the linear differential equation:
```
dx/dt = Hx
```
where H is an n×n matrix encoding the system's physics. For quantum systems, H represents the Hamiltonian; for classical systems, it may represent the linearized dynamics near an equilibrium point.

For continuous operators Ĥ on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we obtain the finite matrix H through Galerkin projection:
```
H_ij = ⟨φ_i|Ĥ|φ_j⟩
```
where {φ_i} is a truncated orthonormal basis set. The choice of basis (e.g., spherical harmonics, plane waves) and truncation order n determines the approximation fidelity.

The matrix elements encode physical interactions:
- **Diagonal elements (H_ii):** Self-energy or decay rates
- **Off-diagonal elements (H_ij):** Coupling strengths between states

**2.2. Eigen-Decomposition and Modal Decoupling**

The eigenvalue equation:
```
Hψ_k = λ_k ψ_k
```
yields eigenvalues {λ_k} and eigenvectors {ψ_k}. For Hermitian H (conservative systems), eigenvalues are real and eigenvectors orthogonal. For non-Hermitian H (dissipative systems), complex eigenvalues encode both frequency and damping.

The eigenvectors form a complete basis, enabling the modal decomposition:
```
x(t) = Σ_k c_k(t)ψ_k
```
where c_k(t) = ⟨ψ_k, x(t)⟩ are the modal amplitudes.

Substituting into the evolution equation yields:
```
dc_k/dt = λ_k c_k
```
Thus the eigen-decomposition decouples the system into independent first-order equations with solutions:
```
c_k(t) = c_k(0)e^(λ_k t)
```

**2.3. Mapping to Digital Audio Synthesis**

For complex eigenvalue λ_k = σ_k + iω_k, the time evolution e^(λ_k t) corresponds to a damped sinusoid:
```
h_k(t) = e^(σ_k t)cos(ω_k t + φ_k)
```

This maps directly to the impulse response of a second-order digital filter. In the z-domain with sampling period Δt:
```
z_k = e^(λ_k Δt) = e^(σ_k Δt)[cos(ω_k Δt) + i·sin(ω_k Δt)]
```

The corresponding digital resonator has transfer function:
```
H_k(z) = A_k / (1 - 2r_k cos(θ_k)z^(-1) + r_k^2 z^(-2))
```
where r_k = e^(σ_k Δt) is the pole radius and θ_k = ω_k Δt is the pole angle.

**2.4. Synthesis Parameter Mapping**

The eigen-decomposition provides complete modal synthesis parameters:
- **Frequencies:** f_k = |Im(λ_k)|/(2π)
- **Damping factors:** ζ_k = -Re(λ_k)/|λ_k|
- **Modal amplitudes:** A_k = |⟨ψ_k, x_0⟩|²

The system's stability follows from the spectral radius: the system is stable if max_k(Re(λ_k)) < 0 (Horn & Johnson, 2013).

#### **3. Implementation Strategies**

**3.1. Exact Method: Direct Diagonalization**

The exact approach computes the complete eigensystem of H:
1. Construct H from physical parameters
2. Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors using numerical algorithms (QR, Arnoldi)
3. Map eigenvalues to resonator parameters
4. Excite modes according to eigenvector projections

Computational complexity: O(n³) for dense matrices, reducible to O(n²) for sparse systems using iterative methods (Saad, 2011).

**3.2. Heuristic Method: Real-Time Approximations**

The `eigensound` implementation employs approximations for real-time performance:

**Analytical Eigenvalue Formulas:** For known geometries, eigenvalues follow analytical patterns:
- Spherical harmonics: E_l = ℏω√(l(l+1))
- Particle in a box: E_n = n²π²ℏ²/(2mL²)
- Harmonic oscillator: E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2)

**Parameter Transformations:** Physical effects are approximated through direct frequency/amplitude modifications:
- Gravitational redshift: ω' = ω(1 - GM/rc²)
- Doppler shift: ω' = ω√((1-β)/(1+β))
- Uncertainty broadening: Δω = ℏ/(2Δt)

**Modal Coupling:** Energy transfer between modes is implemented through frame-by-frame amplitude modulation:
```
A_k(t+1) = A_k(t) + ε Σ_j W_kj A_j(t)
```
where W_kj represents coupling strength between modes k and j.

**3.3. Comparative Analysis**

| Aspect | Exact Method | Heuristic Method |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Eigenvalue Computation** | Numerical diagonalization O(n³) | Analytical formulas O(1) |
| **Parameter Dependencies** | Implicit through H matrix | Explicit transformations |
| **Mode Coupling** | Emergent from off-diagonal terms | Programmed energy exchange |
| **Fidelity** | High; captures all interactions | Medium; primary effects only |
| **Real-time Capability** | Limited to small n (<100) | Scales to large n (>1000) |

#### **4. Eigen-Filtering: A Novel Audio Effect**

**4.1. Mathematical Formulation**

Eigen-Filtering transforms audio through projection onto a system's eigenbasis:

Given input spectrum X(ω) and system eigenbasis {ψ_k, λ_k}:
1. **Modal Decomposition:** c_k = ⟨ψ_k, X⟩
2. **Eigenvalue-Dependent Filtering:** c'_k = g(λ_k)·c_k
3. **Modal Reconstruction:** Y(ω) = Σ_k c'_k ψ_k

The transfer function g(λ) can implement various transformations:
- **Resonant Enhancement:** g(λ) = 1/(1 + |λ - λ_target|²)
- **Modal Quantization:** g(λ) = 1 if λ ∈ {λ_dominant}, 0 otherwise
- **Stability Filtering:** g(λ) = exp(-α·Re(λ))

**4.2. Distinction from Conventional Filtering**

Traditional filters apply frequency-dependent gain/phase according to designed response curves. Eigen-Filtering applies physically-constrained transformations where all frequency relationships are determined by the system matrix H. This preserves the physical coherence of the chosen system model.

**4.3. Applications**

- **Timbre Transfer:** Impose the resonant characteristics of system A onto audio from source B
- **Modal Cleanup:** Project noisy signals onto stable eigenmodes for denoising
- **Cross-Synthesis:** Use audio amplitude envelopes to excite physical model resonances

#### **5. Results and Applications**

**5.1. Scientific Applications**

The framework enables auditory exploration of parameter spaces in various domains:

**Quantum Systems:** Eigenvalue degeneracy lifting produces audible beat frequencies proportional to perturbation strength. Phase transitions manifest as sudden timbral shifts when eigenvalue ordering changes (Dutta et al., 2010).

**Molecular Dynamics:** Normal mode analysis of protein structures reveals characteristic frequencies. Conformational changes produce trackable pitch variations (Dunn & Jernigan, 2015).

**Network Analysis:** Graph Laplacian eigenvalues encode connectivity patterns. Community structure emerges as harmonic relationships between modes (Newman, 2010).

**5.2. Artistic Applications**

The system introduces novel compositional parameters:
- **Quantum Uncertainty:** Controls spectral bandwidth through time-energy uncertainty
- **Gravitational Curvature:** Warps the frequency spectrum following relativistic corrections
- **Coupling Strength:** Determines energy flow between resonant modes

These parameters offer holistic timbral control, where single parameter changes affect the entire spectrum in physically consistent ways.

**5.3. Perceptual Validation**

Informal listening tests suggest that musically trained listeners can distinguish between exact and heuristic implementations for simple systems (n < 10) but find both perceptually valid for complex systems (n > 50). This supports the practical utility of the heuristic approach for real-time applications.

#### **6. Discussion**

**6.1. Relationship to Existing Synthesis Methods**

Our approach extends the lineage of physical modeling:

| Method | Physical Basis | Computational Model |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| Digital Waveguides | Wave equation solutions | Delay lines + filters |
| Mass-Spring Networks | Newton's laws | Coupled oscillators |
| Finite Element Methods | Continuum mechanics | Spatial discretization |
| **Eigen-Synthesis** | **Linear operators** | **Modal decomposition** |

While previous methods model specific acoustic phenomena, Eigen-Synthesis generalizes to abstract mathematical structures.

**6.2. Limitations and Future Directions**

Current limitations include:
- Restriction to linear systems (non-linear extensions via Koopman operators)
- Computational constraints for large matrices
- Limited real-time parameter modulation in exact method

Future work will explore:
- GPU acceleration for real-time eigenvalue computation
- Application to time-varying systems H(t)
- Integration with machine learning for system identification

**6.3. Broader Implications**

This work suggests a paradigm where mathematical structures become directly experiential through sound. As computational power increases, real-time sonification of increasingly complex systems becomes feasible, potentially revealing new insights through auditory pattern recognition.

#### **7. Conclusion**

We have presented a framework that transforms abstract linear systems into playable digital instruments through eigen-decomposition. The mathematical structure of a system directly determines its acoustic properties, creating sounds that are authentic to the underlying physics rather than merely inspired by it. The practical implementation demonstrates that useful approximations can achieve real-time performance while maintaining perceptual validity. This approach opens new possibilities for both scientific data exploration and artistic expression, suggesting that the boundary between mathematical formalism and aesthetic experience may be more permeable than traditionally assumed.
