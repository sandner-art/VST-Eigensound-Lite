### **Part 1: Contribution from Dr. Anya Sharma (Physics & Sonification)**

**1.1. Physical Formalism: The Hamiltonian as the System's Descriptor**
- Briefly define the role of the Hamiltonian operator (`Ĥ`) in quantum mechanics as the observable corresponding to the total energy of a system.
- State the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (`Ĥψ = Eψ`) and explicitly identify it as the quintessential eigenvalue problem in physics.
- **Justification:** Explain that the stationary states of a quantum system *are* its eigenstates. The energy spectrum (the set of all possible `E` values) is the system's most fundamental, observable property. Therefore, mapping these energy eigenvalues to frequencies is the most direct and physically meaningful sonification possible.

**1.2. Justifying the Parameterization in `eigensound`**
- Provide a conceptual justification for how physical parameters modify the Hamiltonian. For example: "An external potential field (e.g., spacetime curvature) breaks the symmetry of the system, which mathematically corresponds to introducing or modifying off-diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian matrix `H`. This lifts degeneracies and mixes the eigenstates, a phenomenon that should be directly audible as timbral and spectral shifts in our sonification."

**1.3. Key Citations for Sonification and Physics**
- Provide 3-5 key citations for the following areas:
    - **Model-Based Sonification:** Papers that sonify the output of a simulation, not just raw data. (e.g., Kramer, G. (Ed.). (1994). *Auditory display: Sonification, audification, and auditory interfaces*).
    - **Sonification in Physics/Astrophysics:** Examples of sonifying astronomical data (e.g., gravitational waves from LIGO) or quantum phenomena.
    - **System Dynamics:** A reference that discusses how a system's behavior is encoded in its governing equations.

### **Part 2: Contribution from Dr. Ben Carter (Computer Music & DSP)**

**2.1. Signal Processing Formalism: Modal Synthesis**
- Define Modal Synthesis as a source-filter technique where the source is an excitation signal and the filter is a parallel bank of resonators.
- Formally state that each resonator is characterized by a frequency, amplitude, and damping factor.
- **The Core Connection:** Explicitly state that the paper's Eigen-Synthesis is a highly advanced form of Modal Synthesis where the resonator parameters (frequencies, damping) are not manually defined but are *derived directly* from the eigenvalues of the system matrix `H`. The amplitudes are derived from the eigenvectors.

**2.2. Novelty and Contribution to Sound Synthesis**
- **Comparison to Traditional Methods:** Briefly contrast with Additive, Subtractive, and FM synthesis, highlighting that Eigen-Synthesis creates *intrinsically coupled* partials, whereas traditional methods treat them as independent.
- **Advancement over Physical Modeling:** Explain that while traditional physical modeling (e.g., Karplus-Strong, digital waveguides) simulates specific acoustic objects, this method generalizes the approach to *any abstract linear system*, vastly expanding the palette of possible "physically-based" sounds.

**2.3. Key Citations for Computer Music**
- Provide 3-5 key citations for:
    - **Modal Synthesis:** The seminal works describing this technique. (e.g., Adrien, J. M. (1991). *The missing link: The musician's viewpoint*).
    - **Physical Modeling Synthesis:** Foundational papers on digital waveguides or other physical modeling techniques. (e.g., Smith, J. O. (1992). *Physical modeling using digital waveguides*).
    - **Generative Music / NIME:** A paper that discusses procedural generation or novel interfaces for musical expression, to situate the artistic claims.

### **Part 3: Contribution from Dr. Lena Ivanova (Mathematics & Linear Algebra)**

**3.1. Mathematical Formalism: The Power of the Eigen-Basis**
- State the Spectral Theorem for Hermitian matrices (if applicable, or the general form of eigen-decomposition).
- **The "Natural Coordinate System" Argument:** Explain that for any linear transformation `T`, its eigenvectors form a basis in which the action of `T` is maximally simple (pure scaling). In this basis, the system's dynamics are decoupled into independent, one-dimensional problems. This is not a trivial change of coordinates; it is a transformation into a basis that reveals the system's intrinsic, fundamental modes of behavior.
- **Formal Definition of Transformation:** Define the projection of a vector `v` onto an eigen-basis `{ψ_i}` as `v = Σ c_i * ψ_i`, where `c_i` are the coefficients. Define the transformation in the eigen-basis as applying a function to these coefficients.

**3.2. Stability and System Evolution**
- Formally define the long-term behavior of an iterative system `x_k+1 = H * x_k`.
- State that as `k → ∞`, the state `x_k` will align with the eigenvector `ψ_max` corresponding to the eigenvalue `λ_max` with the largest magnitude (the dominant eigenvalue).
- **Justification:** This provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for the claim that the synthesized sound will "settle" into a stable state, mimicking real-world resonators. The system's "ringing" is a manifestation of its convergence towards its principal eigenvector.

**3.3. Canonical Citations for Linear Algebra**
- Provide 2-3 canonical, authoritative textbook citations for:
    - **The Eigenvalue Problem:** A standard, widely-used linear algebra textbook. (e.g., Strang, G. (2016). *Introduction to Linear Algebra*).
    - **Dynamical Systems:** A text that connects matrix exponentiation and eigenvalues to the evolution of systems over time.
