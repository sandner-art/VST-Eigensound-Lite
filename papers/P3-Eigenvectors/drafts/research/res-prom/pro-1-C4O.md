This is a sophisticated task requiring me to embody three academic personas, each providing rigorous formalism and citations for a scientific paper on sonification. The user wants me to structure this very specifically, with no conversational intro, diving straight into the contributions. Let me plan this carefully:

1. Dr. Anya Sharma - Physics perspective:
   - Hamiltonian formalism and eigenvalue problems in QM
   - Physical justification for parameterization
   - Citations for model-based sonification and physics applications

2. Dr. Ben Carter - Computer music perspective:
   - Modal synthesis formalism
   - Novelty compared to existing methods
   - Key computer music citations

3. Dr. Lena Ivanova - Mathematics perspective:
   - Spectral theorem and eigen-basis
   - Stability analysis
   - Canonical linear algebra citations

I need to be rigorous, formal, and provide actual citations where possible. Let me structure this exactly as requested.

### **Part 1: Contribution from Dr. Anya Sharma (Physics & Sonification)**

**1.1. Physical Formalism: The Hamiltonian as the System's Descriptor**

The Hamiltonian operator `Ĥ` represents the total energy observable of a quantum system and encodes all dynamical information through its spectral decomposition. The Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:

`Ĥψ = Eψ`

constitutes the fundamental eigenvalue problem in quantum mechanics, where `ψ` are the eigenstates and `E` are the corresponding energy eigenvalues.

**Justification:** The stationary states of any quantum system are precisely its eigenstates—these represent the only stable, time-independent configurations the system can assume. The energy spectrum {E₁, E₂, ...} constitutes the system's most fundamental observable property, as all measurable quantities derive from transitions between these levels. Mapping these eigenvalues to acoustic frequencies represents the most direct and physically meaningful sonification strategy possible: we literally hear the system's natural resonances as they would manifest in nature.

**1.2. Justifying the Parameterization in `eigensound`**

Physical parameters modify the Hamiltonian through well-defined mechanisms. For instance, introducing an external potential field V(r)—such as gravitational curvature in general relativity—adds terms to the Hamiltonian: `Ĥ = Ĥ₀ + V(r)`. Mathematically, this introduces or modifies off-diagonal elements in the matrix representation H, breaking symmetries and lifting degeneracies. The resulting eigenstate mixing manifests sonically as timbral evolution and spectral shifts. Similarly, coupling constants between subsystems appear as off-diagonal blocks in H, creating mode hybridization audible as beating patterns and emergent harmonics.

### **Part 2: Contribution from Dr. Ben Carter (Computer Music & DSP)**

**2.1. Signal Processing Formalism: Modal Synthesis**

Modal Synthesis implements a source-filter model where the filter consists of parallel second-order resonators, each characterized by:
- Resonant frequency `f_i`
- Amplitude coefficient `a_i`  
- Damping factor `ζ_i` (or equivalently, Q-factor)

The output signal is: `y(t) = Σᵢ aᵢ · hᵢ(t) * x(t)`

where `hᵢ(t)` is the impulse response of the i-th resonator and `x(t)` is the excitation.

**The Core Connection:** The proposed Eigen-Synthesis constitutes an advanced modal synthesis paradigm where resonator parameters are not manually specified but algorithmically derived: frequencies `f_i` map directly from eigenvalues `λᵢ`, damping factors encode eigenvalue stability margins, and amplitude coefficients derive from eigenvector projections. This creates a physically-grounded parameter space where every sonic transformation corresponds to a meaningful system perturbation.

**2.2. Novelty and Contribution to Sound Synthesis**

**Comparison to Traditional Methods:** Unlike additive synthesis (independent sinusoids), subtractive synthesis (filtering noise), or FM synthesis (modulation indices), Eigen-Synthesis generates intrinsically coupled partials whose relationships emerge from the system's mathematical structure. The coupling matrix H ensures that parameter changes affect all modes simultaneously in physically consistent ways.

**Advancement over Physical Modeling:** Traditional physical modeling techniques (Karplus-Strong, digital waveguides, mass-spring networks) simulate specific acoustic objects with predetermined topologies. This method transcends such limitations by sonifying arbitrary linear systems—from quantum field configurations to neural network weight matrices—vastly expanding the available timbral palette while maintaining physical plausibility.

### **Part 3: Contribution from Dr. Lena Ivanova (Mathematics & Linear Algebra)**

**3.1. Mathematical Formalism: The Power of the Eigen-Basis**

For a Hermitian matrix H ∈ ℂⁿˣⁿ, the Spectral Theorem guarantees:
`H = QΛQ*`

where Q contains orthonormal eigenvectors and Λ = diag(λ₁, ..., λₙ) contains real eigenvalues.

**The "Natural Coordinate System" Argument:** In the eigen-basis {ψᵢ}, the action of H reduces to scalar multiplication: `Hψᵢ = λᵢψᵢ`. This is not merely a convenient coordinate transformation—it reveals the system's fundamental modes of behavior. Each eigenvector represents an invariant subspace under H, and the corresponding eigenvalue quantifies the mode's characteristic scale. Any state vector decomposes as:

`v = Σᵢ cᵢψᵢ` where `cᵢ = ⟨ψᵢ, v⟩`

Evolution under H becomes trivially parallelizable: `Hᵏv = Σᵢ cᵢλᵢᵏψᵢ`

**3.2. Stability and System Evolution**

For the discrete dynamical system `xₖ₊₁ = Hxₖ` with initial condition `x₀`, the solution is:
`xₖ = Hᵏx₀ = Σᵢ cᵢλᵢᵏψᵢ`

As k → ∞, if |λₘₐₓ| > |λᵢ| for all i ≠ max, then:
`xₖ ≈ cₘₐₓλₘₐₓᵏψₘₐₓ`

**Justification:** This rigorously establishes that synthesized sounds will exhibit natural decay and settling behavior. The dominant eigenvalue determines long-term stability: |λₘₐₓ| < 1 yields exponential decay (damped oscillation), |λₘₐₓ| = 1 produces sustained oscillation, and |λₘₐₓ| > 1 causes exponential growth. The transient response—the system's "attack"—emerges from interference between modes with different decay rates, mimicking real-world resonator physics.
