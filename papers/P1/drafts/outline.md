# Sonification of Quantum Mechanics for Scientific Exploration and Artistic Expression: A Dual-Validity Framework

**Authors:** Daniel Sandner  
**Target Journal:** Leonardo (MIT Press) or Journal of New Music Research  

## Abstract (250 words)

The sonification of scientific data traditionally faces a fundamental tension between empirical accuracy for research purposes and aesthetic appeal for creative applications. This paper presents a novel "dual-validity" framework that resolves this dichotomy through the implementation of Eigensound Lite, an interactive quantum mechanics sonification system. By mapping quantum phenomena—energy quantization, superposition, tunneling, and entanglement—to sonic parameters, we demonstrate that scientific constraints can enhance rather than limit artistic expression. Our implementation reveals that the discrete nature of quantum mechanics naturally creates musical scales, while probabilistic behaviors generate compelling rhythmic and timbral variations impossible with traditional synthesis. Through case studies including particle-in-a-box visualization, quantum sequencing, and real-time parameter manipulation, we validate both scientific utility (energy level identification, anomaly detection) and artistic merit (novel timbres, generative composition). The resulting system serves simultaneously as a research tool for physicists and a creative instrument for musicians, proving that rigorous science and expressive art are mutually reinforcing rather than mutually exclusive.
