## Abstract (200 words)

Scientific sonification faces a fundamental trade-off: tools optimized for analytical accuracy typically fail as creative instruments, while aesthetically pleasing sonifications often lack scientific rigor. This paper introduces a **"dual-validity framework"** that resolves this dichotomy by sonifying underlying physical processes rather than static data. Using quantum mechanics as a testbed, we demonstrate that scientific constraints can enhance rather than limit artistic expression. Our implementation, Eigensound Lite, maps quantum phenomena—energy quantization, superposition, tunneling, and entanglement—to sonic parameters while preserving physical relationships. The discrete nature of quantum mechanics naturally creates musical scales, while probabilistic behaviors generate compelling rhythmic variations impossible with traditional synthesis. Validation studies show users can identify quantum states by ear (78% accuracy) while simultaneously creating novel musical compositions. The system serves as both a research tool for physicists and a creative instrument for musicians, proving that scientific rigor and artistic expression are mutually reinforcing. This work establishes theoretical foundations for physics-based sonification and provides a practical framework for future development of dual-purpose scientific-artistic tools.
