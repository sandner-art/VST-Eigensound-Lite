**1. Introduction**
*   **1.1. Background on Sonification:**
    *   Define sonification: the use of non-speech audio to convey information or perceptualize data.
    *   Provide brief examples of existing sonification domains (e.g., astronomical data, financial markets, medical monitoring).
    *   Establish the value of sonification for pattern recognition and aesthetic exploration.
*   **1.2. Inversive Geometry as a Data Source:**
    *   Introduce inversive geometry as a rich, non-linear, yet highly structured mathematical system.
    *   Briefly explain its fundamental concepts: inversion in a circle, the mapping of circles/lines to circles/lines, and its conformal (angle-preserving) nature.
    *   Position it as an ideal candidate for sonification due to its inherent structure and complex transformations.
*   **1.3. Problem Statement & Contribution:**
    *   State the research gap: The sonification of abstract, classical geometries is a largely unexplored area compared to the sonification of statistical or physical simulation data.
    *   State your contribution: This paper introduces a novel, systematic framework for mapping the parameters and transformations of inversive geometry to the control parameters of real-time sound synthesis.
*   **1.4. Paper Structure:**
    *   Briefly outline the subsequent sections of the paper.

**2. Methodology: From Geometry to Sound**
*   **2.1. Mathematical Foundations:**
    *   Formal definition of inversion in the complex plane: `f(z) = c + r² / (z̄ - c̄)`. Explain each term.
    *   Description of the key geometric properties chosen for sonification:
        *   Distance from the inversion center.
        *   Preservation of angles (Conformality).
        *   Reversal of orientation.
        *   The cross-ratio as an invariant.
    *   Introduce the specific geometric transforms implemented in the demonstrator (Möbius, Stereographic, Cardioid, Lemniscate) and the mathematical reason for their inclusion (e.g., exploring singularities, projection from higher dimensions).
*   **2.2. The Sonification Mapping Framework:**
    *   This is the core of your method. Detail the mapping from the geometric domain to the sonic domain. A table is highly recommended here.
    *   **Table 2.1: Geometric-Sonic Parameter Mapping**
| Geometric Parameter | Mapping Strategy | Sonic Parameter | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Input signal amplitude `x` | Point on the real axis | Base value for transformation | Treats the audio waveform as a 1D geometric space. |
| Inversion Radius `r` | User Control | Controls magnitude of change | Larger radius leads to more subtle changes far from center. |
| Inversion Center `c` | User Control | Point of maximal transformation | Determines the focal point of the sonic effect. |
| Distance `|x-c|` | Calculated | Amplitude/Filter Modulation | Points near center undergo extreme transformation (sonic chaos). |
| Algorithm Choice | User Selection | Synthesis/DSP algorithm | Selects a distinct family of geometric-sonic mappings. |
*   **2.3. Algorithm-Specific Mappings:**
    *   **Amplitude Inversion:** The most direct mapping; explain how `x'` is calculated and applied as a waveshaping function.
    *   **Spectral Inversion:** Detail how the inversion formula is applied to the frequency domain (FFT bins) rather than the time domain. Explain that this warps timbre by re-mapping partials non-linearly.
    *   **Möbius & Other Transforms:** Describe how these more complex functions are used to manipulate the input signal, often introducing phase or time-based artifacts.
*   **2.4. System Implementation: The Sound Laboratory Demonstrator:**
    *   Describe the architecture of the web application.
    *   Mention key technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and critically, the **Web Audio API**.
    *   Provide a block diagram of the audio signal chain:
        *   `Sound Source (Oscillator/Sample/etc.)` -> `ScriptProcessorNode (Geometric Transform)` -> `Gain/Effects (Post-Processing)` -> `AnalyserNode` -> `Destination`
    *   Explain the purpose of the real-time visualizations (Waveform, Spectrum, Geometry) as providing crucial feedback for the user to understand the connection between their actions and the sonic result.

**3. Results: Sonic Characteristics and Expressive Potential**
*   **3.1. Qualitative Analysis of Sonic Output:**
    *   Describe the characteristic sounds produced by each algorithm. Use descriptive audio terminology.
        *   *Example:* "Amplitude inversion produced a 'gating' or 'over-compression' effect, creating sharp transients when the signal crossed the inversion center."
        *   *Example:* "Spectral inversion consistently yielded metallic, inharmonic timbres, as the linear harmonic series of the input was warped into a non-linear series of partials."
        *   *Example:* "The Cardioid transform, with its cusp, introduced a unique, sharp distortion, while the Lemniscate transform created a smoother, figure-eight-like modulation pattern in the sound."
*   **3.2. Visual Analysis of Transformed Waveforms:**
    *   Include figures (screenshots from your app).
    *   **Figure 1:** A simple sine wave (input) vs. the transformed wave (output) for a given algorithm.
    *   **Figure 2:** The frequency spectrum of a simple sound vs. the complex, warped spectrum after spectral inversion.
*   **3.3. Exploration of the Parameter Space:**
    *   Describe how manipulating the main controls (`radius`, `center`, `intensity`) affects the output.
    *   *Example:* "Varying the `radius` was found to control the overall intensity of the effect, while sweeping the `center` parameter through the waveform's amplitude range acted as a complex, non-linear filter sweep."
*   **3.4. Soundscape Mode as a Compositional Environment:**
    *   Describe the results of layering multiple, independent geometric systems.
    *   Explain how this leads to emergent, complex, and evolving sonic textures, demonstrating the compositional potential of the framework.

**4. Discussion**
*   **4.1. Interpretation of Results:**
    *   Connect the sonic results back to the underlying mathematics. Why does it sound the way it does?
    *   *Example:* "The creation of inharmonic timbres is a direct perceptual consequence of breaking the integer-multiple frequency relationships of a harmonic sound, which is precisely what the non-linear inversion function achieves in the spectral domain."
*   **4.2. Comparison with Existing Synthesis Techniques:**
    *   Compare your method to established techniques like FM synthesis, granular synthesis, or waveshaping.
    *   Highlight what makes your approach novel (e.g., control paradigm is geometric, not based on traditional acoustic models; complexity arises from a different source).
*   **4.3. Applications and Potential:**
    *   **Sound Design:** A new tool for creating unique sound effects for film, games, and interactive media.
    *   **Musical Composition:** A source of inspiration and material for experimental and electroacoustic music.
    *   **Data Perception:** A potential method for exploring any system that can be modeled with complex variables or geometry.
*   **4.4. Limitations and Future Work:**
    *   Acknowledge the limitations (e.g., use of deprecated `ScriptProcessorNode`).
    *   Propose future research directions:
        *   Migration to **AudioWorklets** for improved performance and stability.
        *   Exploration of 3D inversive geometry (using ambisonics for spatialization).
        *   Using machine learning to explore the vast parameter space or to learn musically-interesting mappings.
        *   Conducting formal user studies to evaluate the system's intuitiveness and expressive range.

**5. Conclusion**
*   Summarize the key findings of the paper.
*   Reiterate the main contribution: a novel and effective framework for sonifying inversive geometry.
*   End with a forward-looking statement about the potential of using abstract mathematics as a foundation for new creative tools in sound and music.
