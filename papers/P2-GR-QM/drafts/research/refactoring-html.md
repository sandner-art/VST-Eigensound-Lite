- **Phase Space Visualization**: Add Wigner function representations showing quantum interference patterns
- **Quantum Correlation Functions**: Better entanglement modeling using Bell-like correlations

### **General Relativity Improvements**
- **Accurate Redshift Formula**: Use the proper gravitational redshift formula z = GM/(rcÂ²) for weak fields or (1-2GM/rcÂ²)^(1/2) for strong fields
- **Spacetime Curvature Visualization**: Add proper metric tensor representations
- **Frame Dragging Effects**: Include rotational spacetime effects

### **Enhanced Visualizations**
- **3D Probability Clouds**: Show quantum wave function amplitudes
- **Spacetime Diagrams**: Visualize light cones and causal structure
