## Abstract

EigenSound Archimedea presents a novel approach to explorative musical visualization and interaction through the application of Archimedean spiral geometry. This experimental platform transforms traditional linear representations of musical scales into dynamic, polar coordinate systems that reveal the inherent mathematical relationships between frequencies, harmonics, and temporal structures. By mapping audio signals onto spiral geometries, the system provides unprecedented insight into the topological nature of musical harmony while offering intuitive interfaces for both educational exploration and creative synthesis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

Music, at its fundamental level, exists as a mathematical phenomenon governed by frequency relationships, harmonic series, and temporal periodicities. Traditional musical interfaces—keyboards, staff notation, and linear sequencers—present these relationships in Cartesian coordinates that often obscure the circular and spiral nature of musical structures. The Archimedean spiral, defined by the polar equation `r = aθ`, provides a natural geometric framework for representing these cyclical relationships while preserving the linear progression of time.

### 1.2 The Archimedean Spiral as Musical Interface

The Archimedean spiral possesses unique properties that align with musical structures:

- **Constant angular spacing**: Each complete rotation represents one octave
- **Linear radial growth**: Distance from center correlates with pitch height
- **Continuous parametrization**: Smooth transitions between discrete note positions
- **Self-similar structure**: Fractal-like repetition of intervallic relationships

This geometric framework allows for the representation of:
- **Chromatic scales** as complete spiral rotations
- **Diatonic scales** as highlighted angular positions
- **Harmonic relationships** as geometric ratios
- **Temporal evolution** as spiral traversal

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Polar Coordinate Mapping

The system implements a bidirectional mapping between musical parameters and polar coordinates:

```
θ = (note_index / 12) × 2π + octave × 2π
r = base_radius × (1 + octave / spiral_density)
```

Where:
- `θ` represents the angular position (note within octave)
- `r` represents the radial distance (octave and amplitude)
- Audio amplitude modulates radial displacement in real-time

### 2.2 Multi-Modal Visualization Engine

The platform implements seven distinct visualization modes, each revealing different aspects of musical structure:

#### 2.2.1 Basic Spiral Mode
Pure Archimedean spiral with amplitude-responsive deformation, providing baseline geometric representation.

#### 2.2.2 Audio Waveform Mode
Real-time audio signal directly modulates spiral radius, creating dynamic visual representations of acoustic energy.

#### 2.2.3 Frequency Band Analysis
Multiple overlaid spirals represent different frequency bands, revealing spectral distribution across the harmonic spectrum.

#### 2.2.4 Epicyclic Harmonics
Implementation of Ptolemaic epicycle theory applied to harmonic series visualization, where each fundamental frequency generates smaller orbital circles representing overtones.

#### 2.2.5 Wave Interference Patterns
Visual representation of acoustic beating and interference phenomena between simultaneous notes, displayed as complex spiral deformations.

#### 2.2.6 Rhythmic Mapping
Temporal beat patterns mapped to angular divisions, with visual pulse intensities corresponding to rhythmic emphasis.

#### 2.2.7 Energy Flow Visualization
Dynamic representation of acoustic energy distribution with distance-based color mapping and intensity gradients.

### 2.3 Wave Shape Analysis

The system implements four distinct algorithms for audio signal analysis:

1. **Amplitude Mapping**: Direct time-domain amplitude to spiral radius
2. **Frequency Analysis**: FFT-based spectral mapping to multiple spiral layers
3. **Phase Correlation**: Complex phase relationships between frequency and time domains
4. **Spectral Centroid**: Advanced analysis of frequency distribution characteristics

### 2.4 Visual Representation Methods

Beyond traditional spiral deformation, the system offers alternative visual mappings:

- **Dot Pattern**: Audio data as variable-sized points along spiral path
- **Perpendicular Lines**: Signal amplitude as orthogonal line segments
