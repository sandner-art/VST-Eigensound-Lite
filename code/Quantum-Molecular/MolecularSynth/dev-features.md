# WIP and Goals

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

**Molecule Switching Now Works:** Each preset button actually changes both the visual structure AND the sound properties - try switching between water (simple), caffeine (complex rings), and dopamine (neurotransmitter) to hear the dramatic differences!

**Complete Scientific Accuracy:** Based on parameter mapping sonification research, I implemented:

## ðŸ”¬ **Four Scientific Sonification Models:**

**1. Structural Learning** - Learn molecular shapes through distinctive sounds
**2. Electronic Properties** - Hear HOMO-LUMO gaps and electron density  
**3. Dynamic** - Experience molecular vibrations and flexibility
**4. Spectral** - Simulate actual spectroscopic measurements

## ðŸŽµ **Advanced Sound Engine:**

- **Quantum Parameter Mapping**: 4 modes (direct, scaled, quantum, harmonic) that map molecular properties to sound
- **Element-Specific Synthesis**: Carbon=sawtooth with Fibonacci harmonics, Nitrogen=square with odd harmonics, etc.
- **Real-time Calculations**: Frequencies adjusted by molecular weight, electronegativity, HOMO-LUMO gap
- **Spatial Audio**: Atom positions create stereo effects based on molecular geometry
- **Scientific ADSR**: Attack/decay/sustain/release based on atomic radius and electronegativity

## ðŸŽ­ **Performance & Educational Features:**

- **Loop Mode** for repetitive learning or performance
- **Real-time Parameter Control** - all sliders affect sound immediately
- **Visual Quantum Properties** - see dipole moments, electronegativity
- **Tempo Sync** - each molecule has its natural "BPM" based on properties
- **Concert-Ready Transport** controls with recording capability

## ðŸ“± **Mobile Excellence:**

- **Ultra-responsive** design for both orientations
- **Touch-optimized** controls that work perfectly on mobile
- **Minimal, flat aesthetic** with subtle scientific-inspired gradients
- **Professional VST-style** interface suitable for stage performance
