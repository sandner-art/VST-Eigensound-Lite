# WIP and Goals
## V5

Perfect! I've implemented all your requested features:

## ðŸŽµ **New Melodic Mode** 
Added the **"Melodic"** mode that creates fluent, musical sequences! It maps atoms to proper musical scales (major, minor, pentatonic, etc.) based on element properties, creating the smooth melody-like results you experienced in version 3.

## ðŸŒŠ **Enhanced Soundscape Mode**
Created a comprehensive **ambient soundscape system**:
- **Multi-layered atmosphere**: 3 oscillators with LFOs for organic movement
- **Molecule-specific ambience**: Caffeine = "stimulant", Water = "fluid", Dopamine = "euphoric" 
- **Visual atmosphere indicator**: Pulsing circle shows when soundscape is active
- **Real-time atmosphere control**: New slider to adjust ambient levels
- **Sustained textures**: Evolving background sounds that build over time

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

**Longer Atom Sounds**: Extended ADSR envelopes - no more cut-off sounds:
- Melodic mode: 1.5 second sustain
- Soundscape mode: 3.0 second sustain  
- Enhanced expression depth control

**Reduced Hover Animation**: Atoms now only scale to 1.1x (instead of 1.3x) making them much easier to click while still providing visual feedback

**Interactive Bonds**: All molecular bonds are now clickable!
- **Single bonds** = sine wave, short duration
- **Double bonds** = sawtooth, medium duration  
- **Triple bonds** = square wave, long duration
- **Aromatic bonds** = triangle wave, sustained

## ðŸŽ­ **5 Complete Sonification Modes:**

1. **Structural** - Learn molecular shapes
2. **Melodic** - Fluent musical sequences âœ¨ NEW
3. **Electronic** - Quantum properties with harmonics
4. **Soundscape** - Ambient molecular atmospheres âœ¨ ENHANCED  
5. **Spectral** - Spectroscopic analysis

Try switching to **Melodic mode** and hit play - you'll hear the smooth, musical sequences! Then switch to **Soundscape mode** and adjust the **Atmosphere slider** to experience the evolving ambient textures that complement the core tones.

The bonds are now clickable too - try clicking the connections between atoms to hear their unique bond sounds! ðŸ”—ðŸŽµ

## âœ… **Fixed Issues:**

**Molecule Switching Now Works:** Each preset button actually changes both the visual structure AND the sound properties - try switching between water (simple), caffeine (complex rings), and dopamine (neurotransmitter) to hear the dramatic differences!

**Complete Scientific Accuracy:** Based on parameter mapping sonification research, I implemented:

## ðŸ”¬ **Four Scientific Sonification Models:**

**1. Structural Learning** - Learn molecular shapes through distinctive sounds
**2. Electronic Properties** - Hear HOMO-LUMO gaps and electron density  
**3. Dynamic** - Experience molecular vibrations and flexibility
**4. Spectral** - Simulate actual spectroscopic measurements

## ðŸŽµ **Advanced Sound Engine:**

- **Quantum Parameter Mapping**: 4 modes (direct, scaled, quantum, harmonic) that map molecular properties to sound
- **Element-Specific Synthesis**: Carbon=sawtooth with Fibonacci harmonics, Nitrogen=square with odd harmonics, etc.
- **Real-time Calculations**: Frequencies adjusted by molecular weight, electronegativity, HOMO-LUMO gap
- **Spatial Audio**: Atom positions create stereo effects based on molecular geometry
- **Scientific ADSR**: Attack/decay/sustain/release based on atomic radius and electronegativity

## ðŸŽ­ **Performance & Educational Features:**

- **Loop Mode** for repetitive learning or performance
- **Real-time Parameter Control** - all sliders affect sound immediately
- **Visual Quantum Properties** - see dipole moments, electronegativity
- **Tempo Sync** - each molecule has its natural "BPM" based on properties
- **Concert-Ready Transport** controls with recording capability

## ðŸ“± **Mobile Excellence:**

- **Ultra-responsive** design for both orientations
- **Touch-optimized** controls that work perfectly on mobile
- **Minimal, flat aesthetic** with subtle scientific-inspired gradients
- **Professional VST-style** interface suitable for stage performance
