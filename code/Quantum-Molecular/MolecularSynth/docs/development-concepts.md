Moving from a direct sonification model to a hybrid, more generative, ambient, and musically sophisticated system. Conceptual approaches for new modes and practical enhancements for a more professional sound:

### 1. Deeper Soundscape & Ambient Modes

The core idea here is to treat the molecule not as a sequence of discrete notes, but as a complex, self-resonating system that generates a continuous texture.

#### A. "Resonant Cavity" Mode (Physical Modeling)

*   **Concept:** Imagine the molecule's entire electron cloud is a resonant physical space, like the body of a cello or a complex drum. Energy flows through it, exciting different resonant frequencies.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Fundamental Drones:** Use the molecule's overall properties (e.g., molecular weight, total number of electrons) to set a low, fundamental drone frequency. Lower MW = higher pitch.
    2.  **Harmonic Nodes (Atoms):** Each atom becomes a "node" that adds its own harmonic character to the drone. Instead of triggering a note, an atom's `baseFreq` and `harmonics` are added to a bank of continuously running oscillators. The amplitude of each harmonic could be modulated by a very slow LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator) to create a shimmering, evolving texture.
    3.  **Bond "Filters":** Bonds act as filters shaping the sound. A double bond could be a resonant band-pass filter, creating a "peak" in the sound. An aromatic ring could be a comb filter, creating a metallic, hollow resonance that reflects its delocalized electrons.
    4.  **Interaction:** Clicking an atom doesn't play a note, but "plucks" the system. It could momentarily boost the amplitude and filter resonance of that atom's corresponding harmonics, sending a ripple through the texture that slowly fades back into the drone.

#### B. "Quantum Fluctuation" Mode (Granular Synthesis)

*   **Concept:** Model the inherent uncertainty and dynamism of a molecule at the quantum level. The sound is not stable but is a cloud of tiny, transient sonic events (grains).
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Grain Cloud:** Create a granular synthesizer engine. The source audio for the grains could be a mix of the elemental waveforms (saw, sine, etc.).
    2.  **Atom Parameters -> Grain Control:**
        *   **HOMO-LUMO Gap:** Controls the average **pitch** of the grains. A smaller gap (more reactive molecule) could lead to a wider, more dissonant pitch range. A larger gap (stable molecule) could create a more focused, tonal cloud.
        *   **Dipole Moment:** Controls the **spatial position/panning** of the grains. A high dipole moment creates a wide stereo field with grains appearing far left and right. A zero-dipole molecule (like Benzene) is perfectly centered and mono.
        *   **Number of Atoms:** Controls the **density** of the grain cloud (grains per second). More atoms = denser, richer texture.
    3.  **Interaction:** Clicking an atom creates a localized "event" in the cloud—perhaps a burst of higher-density, higher-pitch grains at that atom's stereo position, which then dissipates back into the main cloud.

#### C. "Vibrational Spectra" Mode (Additive Synthesis)

*   **Concept:** Molecules are constantly vibrating in specific ways (stretching, bending, scissoring). These are known as vibrational modes, and they can be measured with IR spectroscopy. Each mode has a specific frequency. This is a treasure trove of real, physically meaningful data.
*   **Implementation:**
    1.  **Find the Data:** Use a chemistry database (like NIST) to find the IR (Infrared) spectrum for your molecules. This gives you a list of real frequencies (in cm⁻¹).
    2.  **Frequency Mapping:** Convert the IR frequencies (e.g., 3000 cm⁻¹) into audible frequencies. You'll need to scale them down by a large factor (e.g., divide by 50-100) to bring them into the 20-20,000 Hz range.
    3.  **Additive Synthesis Engine:** For each molecule, create a bank of `sine` wave oscillators. Set the frequency of each oscillator to one of the scaled vibrational frequencies from the IR spectrum.
    4.  **Modulation:** The amplitude of each oscillator can be modulated slowly and independently with LFOs to create a constantly shifting, complex, but physically accurate overtone structure. The sound would be incredibly rich and unique to each molecule.

### 2. More Professional & Intuitive Sound Settings

To make the sound design more powerful, consolidate and re-label your controls to reflect standard synthesis parameters. This is more intuitive for users familiar with synths and more powerful for everyone.

#### A. Re-imagining the Controls Panel

Instead of "Sound Character" and "Sonification Model," think like a synth designer:

**Section 1: OSCILLATOR (The Core Tone)**
*   **Element Timbre:** A single XY pad. X-axis could be `Waveform Mix` (Sine -> Triangle -> Saw -> Square). Y-axis could be `Harmonic Complexity` (from the old slider). This is far more intuitive than separate sliders.
*   **Detune / Drift:** A knob that introduces slight, random pitch variations to the oscillators, making the sound more "analog" and organic. This could be linked to the "Molecular Dynamics" slider.
*   **Sub Oscillator:** A simple knob to add a lower-octave sine or square wave for more body and weight.

**Section 2: FILTER (Shaping the Tone)**
*   **Filter Type:** A button to switch between Low-Pass (warm), High-Pass (thin), and Band-Pass (focused/nasal).
*   **Cutoff:** Your "Timbre Clarity" slider, but renamed to the industry standard.
*   **Resonance:** Your "Electronic Resonance" slider, renamed. This control is crucial for sound design.

**Section 3: ENVELOPE (The Shape of the Note)**
*   **ADSR Knobs:** Instead of a fixed envelope, give the user four knobs: **Attack**, **Decay**, **Sustain**, **Release**. This is the single biggest step towards professional sound shaping.
    *   **Attack:** How fast the note fades in. (Plucked vs. Swelling Pad)
    *   **Decay:** How fast it drops to the sustain level.
    *   **Sustain:** The volume level while the key is held.
    *   **Release:** How long the note rings out after the key is released.

**Section 4: MODULATION & FX (Movement and Space)**
*   **LFO -> Pitch/Filter:** A knob for "Vibrato" or "Wah-Wah" amount. This LFO controls how much the pitch or filter cutoff wobbles over time.
*   **Spatial FX:** Combine "Spatial Width" and "Atmosphere" into a more powerful FX section.
    *   **Reverb:** A single knob for "Space," blending from a dry sound to a small room to a large hall.
    *   **Delay:** A knob for "Echoes" with a related "Feedback" control.
