# Interactive Molecular Sonification App Design

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native with Web Assembly (WASM) for cross-platform mobile/web
- **Audio Engine**: Web Audio API with Tone.js for synthesis and effects
- **3D Visualization**: Three.js (React Three Fiber) with optimized molecular renderers
- **Molecular Data**: Pre-computed quantum properties from PubChem/QuanDB APIs
- **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, performant state handling

### Performance Optimization Strategy
```
Mobile-First Approach:
â”œâ”€â”€ Pre-computed molecular properties (no real-time QM calculations)
â”œâ”€â”€ Level-of-detail (LOD) rendering for complex molecules  
â”œâ”€â”€ Audio synthesis using additive/FM methods (CPU efficient)
â”œâ”€â”€ Gesture-based interaction with haptic feedback
â””â”€â”€ Progressive loading of molecular data
```

## Sonification Models

### 1. **Structural Learning Model** (Educational Core)
**Purpose**: Learn molecular shapes and functional groups through unique audio signatures

**Implementation**:
- **Atoms**: Each element gets a characteristic timbre (C=warm saw, O=bright sine, N=filtered square)
- **Bonds**: Single=steady tone, Double=tremolo, Triple=rapid vibrato, Aromatic=chorus effect
- **Functional Groups**: Memorable chord progressions (OH=major 7th, C=O=minor triad + overtone)
- **Molecular Geometry**: VSEPR shapes mapped to specific scales (tetrahedral=pentatonic, octahedral=blues scale)

### 2. **Electronic Properties Model**
**Purpose**: Understand electron density and chemical reactivity

**Implementation**:
- **HOMO-LUMO Gap**: Overall pitch range (narrow gap=low register, wide gap=high register)
- **Electron Density**: Volume/brightness mapping
- **Electrostatic Potential**: Stereo panning (positive=right, negative=left)
- **Polarizability**: Chorus depth and modulation speed

### 3. **Dynamic Exploration Model**
**Purpose**: Experience molecular flexibility and conformational changes

**Implementation**:
- **Bond Vibrations**: Direct frequency mapping of vibrational modes
- **Conformational Changes**: Smooth morphing between different harmonic structures
- **Rotational Barriers**: Pitch bending with energy-dependent modulation
- **Thermal Motion**: Controlled randomness/noise levels

### 4. **Spectroscopic Model**
**Purpose**: Connect molecular structure to experimental observables

**Implementation**:
- **IR Spectrum**: Filtered noise matching absorption bands
- **UV-Vis**: Color-to-pitch mapping with quantum mechanical accuracy
- **NMR**: Chemical shift mapping to specific frequency ranges
- **Mass Spec**: Fragmentation patterns as rhythmic sequences

## UI/UX Design Framework

### Core Design Philosophy
```
Molecule as Interface Paradigm:
â”œâ”€â”€ 3D molecular model = primary control surface
â”œâ”€â”€ Direct atom/bond manipulation for real-time sonification
â”œâ”€â”€ Contextual controls appear on molecular features
â”œâ”€â”€ Minimalist HUD with essential information only
â””â”€â”€ Gesture-driven interaction (tap, drag, pinch, rotate)
```
