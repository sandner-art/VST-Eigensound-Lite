## 1. Scientific Foundation

### 1.1 Quantum Mechanical Principles

**Hydrogen Atom Wave Functions**
The hydrogen atom wave function ψₙₗₘ(r,θ,φ) is characterized by three quantum numbers:
- **n** (principal): Energy levels (1, 2, 3...)
- **ℓ** (orbital angular momentum): Orbital shape (0=s, 1=p, 2=d, 3=f...)
- **m** (magnetic): Spatial orientation (-ℓ to +ℓ)

**Helium Complexity**
Helium introduces electron-electron interactions, creating:
- Exchange energy effects
- Correlation between electron movements
- Singlet and triplet spin states
- More complex energy landscapes

### 1.2 Key Sonifiable Properties

1. **Probability Density Distributions**: |ψ|² values across 3D space
2. **Radial Nodes**: Zero-probability spherical surfaces
3. **Angular Nodes**: Zero-probability planes/surfaces
4. **Energy Level Transitions**: Spectral lines and photon emissions
5. **Orbital Hybridization**: Linear combinations of atomic orbitals
6. **Electron Spin Correlations**: Quantum entanglement effects

## 2. Novel Sonification Strategies

### 2.1 Spatial Audio Mapping

**3D Orbital Sonification**
- Map orbital probability density to **binaural audio intensity**
- Use **HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Functions)** to position probability maxima in 3D space
- Create **spatial audio sculptures** where users navigate through electron clouds
- **Doppler effects** when moving through probability gradients

**Implementation**: WebAudio API with binaural rendering, allowing users to "fly through" orbitals with headphones creating immersive 3D audio experiences.

### 2.2 Quantum Number Musical Mapping

**Harmonic Series Correspondence**
- **n** (principal quantum number) → **Fundamental frequency** (octaves)
- **ℓ** (angular momentum) → **Harmonic content** (timbre complexity)
- **m** (magnetic) → **Stereo panning/phase** (spatial positioning)
- **s** (spin) → **Rhythmic patterns** (binary on/off states)

**Mathematical Relationship**:
```
Frequency = f₀ × n²  (Rydberg-like scaling)
Harmonics = 2^ℓ partials
Pan = m/(2ℓ+1) × 180°
```

### 2.3 Wave Function Interference Sonification

**Beat Frequencies from Quantum Superposition**
- When orbitals overlap, create **beat frequencies** proportional to wave interference
- **Constructive interference** → Louder amplitude, consonant intervals
- **Destructive interference** → Amplitude drops, dissonant intervals
- **Real-time calculation** of interference patterns as audio modulation

### 2.4 Uncertainty Principle Audio

**Heisenberg Sonification**
- **Position uncertainty** → **Frequency bandwidth** (spectral width)
- **Momentum uncertainty** → **Temporal spreading** (attack/decay times)
- Demonstrate trade-off: precise pitch = longer duration, noise bursts = short duration
