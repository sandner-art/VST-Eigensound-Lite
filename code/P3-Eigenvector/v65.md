### **🎙️ Recording & Audio Routing**
- **One-Click Recording** - Capture all output audio as downloadable files
- **Synthesis → Filter Routing** - Route modal synthesis through Eigen-Filter for complex soundscapes
- **Live Mixing** - Combine microphone input with synthesis through filter chain

### **🌀 Advanced Physics Controls (Phase 3)**
- **H(t) Time Evolution** - Animated matrix changes create dynamic soundscapes
- **Phase Transition Detection** - Automatic detection of eigenvalue bifurcations
- **Evolution Rate Control** - User-adjustable speed of matrix evolution
- **Quantum Coherence Effects** - Enhanced uncertainty with modal interactions
