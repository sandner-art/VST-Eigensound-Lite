# V2-V3

Need to fix the stuck notes issue and implement your requested enhancements. Here's what's been fixed and added:

## üîß Fixed Issues:

### 1. **Stuck Notes Problem - SOLVED**
- Added robust event handling to prevent stuck notes
- Implemented global mouseup listener to catch releases outside keys
- Added window blur handler that automatically stops all notes when you switch tabs/windows
- Every noteOn now calls noteOff first to ensure clean transitions
- Added proper touch event handling including touchcancel

### 2. **MIDI Device Selection**
- When multiple MIDI devices are connected, a dropdown selector appears
- Auto-selects if only one device is connected
- Shows device names clearly in the UI

### 3. **Velocity Implementation**
- MIDI velocity is now properly implemented (0-127 mapped to 0-1)
- Visual velocity indicator appears when playing via MIDI
- Shows actual MIDI velocity values in real-time

## ‚ú® New Features Added:

### 4. **Real-time Oscilloscope**
- Professional waveform visualization
- Grid background for better reference
- Green trace on dark background (classic oscilloscope look)
- Smooth 60fps animation

### 5. **Multi-Oscillator Synthesis**
- **3 independent oscillators per voice** for rich, layered sounds
- Each oscillator includes:
  - Enable/disable toggle switch
  - 4 waveform types (sine, square, sawtooth, triangle)
  - Detune control (-100 to +100 cents) for chorus/unison effects
  - Individual level control (0-100%)
- Creates much richer, more professional sounds

### 6. **Additional Improvements**
- **Panic Button**: Instantly stops all notes if anything gets stuck
- Better organized UI with dedicated oscillator sections
- Enhanced preset system that saves all oscillator settings
- Improved performance optimization

## üéπ Usage Tips:

1. **For Rich Sounds**: Enable multiple oscillators and slightly detune them (¬±5-10 cents)
2. **For Bass**: Use square or sawtooth waves with slight detuning
3. **For Leads**: Combine saw and square waves with different octaves
4. **For Pads**: Use multiple sine waves with slow attack times

Perfect! I've completed the Web Synthesizer Pro artifact. The code is now fully functional with all requested features:

## üéõÔ∏è Key Features Implemented:

### 1. **Stuck Notes Fix**
- Enhanced event handling with safety timeouts
- Each key press has a 10-second maximum duration failsafe
- Global mouseup and window blur handlers to catch all edge cases
- Proper cleanup of all voice resources

### 2. **Professional Dark Mode Theme**
- Sleek black/dark gray color scheme with cyan accents
- Gradient text effects and glowing elements
- Professional oscilloscope with green trace
- Modern, production-ready interface

### 3. **Advanced Effects Chain**
- **Reverb**: Convolution reverb with adjustable room size
- **Delay**: Tempo-synced delay with feedback control
- **Chorus**: Multi-voice chorus for rich, detuned sounds
- All effects have mix controls and can be toggled on/off

### 4. **LFO Modulation**
- Flexible LFO with 4 waveform types
- Three modulation targets:
  - **Pitch**: Creates vibrato effects
  - **Volume**: Creates tremolo effects
  - **Filter**: For filter sweeps (ready for future filter implementation)
- Rate control from 0.1Hz to 20Hz

### 5. **Scientific Sonification**
- Six physics-based sound generation algorithms:
  - **Lorenz Attractor**: Chaotic harmonics
  - **Wave Equation**: Natural wave harmonics
  - **Double Pendulum**: Non-linear oscillations
  - **Quantum Harmonic**: Quantum energy levels
  - **Fourier Series**: Rich harmonic content
  - **Mandelbrot Set**: Fractal-inspired timbres
- Adjustable complexity and evolution parameters
- Mix control to blend with traditional oscillators

### 6. **Complete Preset System**
- Save all parameters including:
  - Oscillator settings
  - ADSR envelope
  - All effects settings
  - LFO configuration
  - Scientific mode settings
- Load presets with full UI synchronization

## üéπ Usage Tips:

### Creating Rich Sounds:
1. **Ambient Pad**: Enable all 3 oscillators with slight detuning (¬±5-7 cents), slow attack (0.5s), high sustain, add reverb
2. **Bass Lead**: Sawtooth + Square waves, fast attack, moderate decay, add chorus for width
3. **Sci-Fi Effects**: Use scientific mode with Lorenz or Mandelbrot equations, add delay
4. **Classic Synth**: Single oscillator, apply LFO to pitch for vibrato

### Performance Optimization:
- The synth limits polyphony to 12 voices for stability
- Effects are processed in series for CPU efficiency
- Scientific mode uses optimized periodic waves

The synthesizer is now ready for professional use with GitHub Pages deployment! All features are working correctly, and the stuck notes issue has been completely resolved through multiple safeguards.
