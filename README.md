> Transform quantum mechanical systems into interactive audio experiences. Explore energy levels, wavefunctions, and quantum phenomena through sound while maintaining scientific accuracy.


## What is This?

Eigensound Lite is a test app for **dual-validity** sonification VST planned to translate quantum mechanics into sound, serving both **scientific analysis** and **artistic creation**. Built on real quantum calculations, it demonstrates how physical constraints can enhance rather than limit creative expression.

Please note that 'Lite' does not mean a lesser version of an app. Eigensound Lite is an interactive testbed for research and concepts developed for a future, more advanced software suite, and it will be updated independently. The functions and uses will be different.

**Key Innovation:** The same tool that helps physicists identify quantum states by ear also enables musicians to create compositions leveraging quantum phenomena in addition to traditional synthesis.

## 🌟 Why Quantum Sonification?

> *"The quantum world doesn't just look different—it may sound different too. By listening to quantum mechanics, we discover that the same mathematical constraints that govern atomic behavior can design interesting sound effects and music."*

**Eigensound Lite proves that scientific rigor and artistic expression are complementary aspects of understanding reality.**
