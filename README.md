> Transform quantum mechanical systems into interactive audio experiences. Explore energy levels, wavefunctions, and quantum phenomena through sound while maintaining scientific accuracy.

## What is This?

Eigensound Lite is a test app for **dual-validity** sonification VST planned to translate quantum mechanics into sound, serving both **scientific analysis** and **artistic creation**. Built on real quantum calculations, it demonstrates how physical constraints can enhance rather than limit creative expression.

**Key Innovation:** The same tool that helps physicists identify quantum states by ear also enables musicians to create compositions leveraging quantum phenomena in addition to traditional synthesis.

> Quantum systems are probabilistic, not random.

## ✨ Features

- **🔬 Scientific Mode:** Analyze quantum systems through real-time audio feedback
- **🎵 Synthesizer:** Interactive quantum synthesis with multiple potential wells  
- **📊 Explorer:** Manipulate quantum parameters and hear the results instantly
- **🎹 Sequencer:** Generate melodies and rhythms from quantum phenomena
- **💾 Profile System:** Save and share quantum configurations
- **📱 Mobile-Friendly:** Works on phones, tablets, and desktops

## Quick Start

1. **[Try the Live Demo](https://sandner.art/VST-Eigensound-Lite)** - No installation required
2. **Select a preset** (Particle in Box, Harmonic Oscillator, etc.)
3. **Click "Excite System"** to hear quantum energy cascades
4. **Drag on the visualization** to edit potential wells in real-time
5. **Explore different tabs** for various quantum sonification modes

## Quantum Modes

| Mode | Description | Audio Signature |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Energy Cascade** | Sequential decay through quantum states | Descending arpeggios with quantum jumps |
| **Superposition** | Multiple simultaneous quantum states | Rich harmonic interference patterns |
| **Entanglement** | Correlated particle pairs | Synchronized but opposite behaviors |
| **Tunneling Beats** | Probabilistic barrier penetration | Irregular rhythms with beat frequencies |

## 🌟 Why Quantum Sonification?

> *"The quantum world doesn't just look different—it sounds different too. By listening to quantum mechanics, we discover that the same mathematical constraints that govern atomic behavior can create beautiful music."*

**Eigensound Lite proves that scientific rigor and artistic expression are not opposing forces, but complementary aspects of understanding reality.**
