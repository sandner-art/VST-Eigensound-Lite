                <h3>P1: Sonification of Quantum Mechanics for Scientific Exploration and Artistic Expression</h3>
                <p>
                    We present a methodological system for sonifying quantum mechanical systems that preserves essential physical relationships while enabling real-time interaction. Unlike data sonification approaches that map static measurements to audio parameters, our process-based method sonifies the underlying dynamical equations governing quantum evolution. This simplified real-time approach maintains the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics—including energy quantization, wavefunction evolution, and measurement-induced collapse—within the audio synthesis process itself. This work establishes computational and theoretical foundations for a class of interactive scientific instruments that serve analytical and creative purposes simultaneously.

                <h3>P2: Sonification of General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics Phenomena</h3>
                <p>
                    Sonification explores and reveals epistemological barriers between quantum mechanics and general relativity that may be not apparent in traditional mathematical or visual representations, providing a new sensory pathway for understanding why these theories resist unification. Psychoacoustic physics tests are aiming for direct use in sound design while fulfilling educational goals.

                <h3>P3: Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues in Scientific Sonification: Complex Physical Systems as Musical Instruments</h3>
                <p>
                    We present a methodology for sound synthesis and processing based on the eigen-decomposition of parameterized linear systems. This approach treats abstract physical models, described by a system matrix H, as digital musical instruments. The system's eigenvalues determine resonant frequencies; eigenvectors define the modal basis for timbre and dynamics. We detail both an exact computational method and a real-time heuristic implementation in the web application `eigensound`. We extend this framework to audio processing through "Eigen-Filtering," where signals are transformed via projection onto a physical system's eigen-basis. This enables modal quantization and physically-modeled cross-synthesis.

                <h3>P4: Real-time Sonification of Inversive Geometry for Complex Sound Synthesis</h3>
                <p>
                    This paper presents a novel conceptual sonification of inversive geometry, enabling new methods for complex sound synthesis and processing. While sonification has been extensively applied to statistical and simulation data, the auditory exploration of abstract mathematical structures is a comparatively underexplored domain. We detail a systematic mapping from the fundamental principles of 2D inversive geometry—including the inversion circle, Möbius transformations, and stereographic projection—to the control parameters of real-time sound synthesis. A proof-of-concept interactive web application system, implemented using the Web Audio API, is presented as a demonstrator. The results show that this geometric approach yields a rich palette of complex, dynamic, and controllable timbres. The core contribution is a new control paradigm for sound design, where sonic complexity emerges from the spatial relationship between a signal and a geometric singularity, rather than from the algebraic complexity of a synthesis function.
