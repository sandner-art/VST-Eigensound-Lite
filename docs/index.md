## ðŸŽµ What is Eigensound Lite?

Eigensound Lite is a revolutionary **dual-validity sonification framework** that translates quantum mechanical systems into sound. Unlike traditional data sonification tools, it maintains both scientific accuracy for research purposes and aesthetic appeal for creative applications.

### **Core Innovation: Dual-Validity Framework**

The same tool that helps physicists identify quantum states by ear also enables musicians to create compositions impossible with traditional synthesis methods. This isn't just "playing data" - it's **interactive quantum simulation** where physical constraints enhance rather than limit creative expression.

### **Key Principles**

- **Scientific Accuracy:** Every sound corresponds to real quantum mechanical calculations
- **Musical Utility:** Quantum constraints create natural musical relationships
- **Educational Value:** Learn quantum physics through direct auditory experience
- **Creative Expression:** Discover novel sonic territories through physics-based constraints
