# User Guide: eigensound|vector

## üéµ Where Mathematics Becomes Music

**eigensound|vector** is a web application that transforms abstract mathematical structures into audible, interactive musical experiences. Unlike traditional audio software that treats sound as a signal to be processed, eigensound|vector treats mathematical systems as living musical instruments.

## üî¨ Core Concept: Eigenvalue Sonification

### The Mathematical Foundation

At its heart, eigensound|vector implements **eigenvalue sonification** - a novel approach where:

- **System Matrix H** represents the physics of a linear system
- **Eigenvalues Œª** determine resonant frequencies and stability
- **Eigenvectors œà** define modal basis functions for timbre
- **Matrix modifications** create real-time changes in harmonic content

This approach is grounded in fundamental physics: from quantum mechanics (Schr√∂dinger equation) to classical mechanics (normal mode analysis), eigenvalue problems describe how systems naturally oscillate.

### Why This Matters

Traditional audio applications manipulate sound as a waveform. eigensound|vector generates sound **from mathematical first principles**, making abstract concepts like:
- Matrix eigenvalues ‚Üí audible frequencies
- Eigenvector phases ‚Üí spatial timbre
- System stability ‚Üí decay rates
- Modal coupling ‚Üí harmonic interactions

**Directly experiential** rather than merely theoretical.

## üöÄ Key Features That Set eigensound|vector Apart

### 1. **Live Eigenvalue Synthesis**

**What it does:** Generates sustained tones at eigenfrequencies with decay rates determined by eigenvalue real parts.

**Why it's unique:** Most synthesis is based on fixed oscillators. Here, the mathematical structure of your system **is** the instrument.

**Synthesis Modes:**
- **Modal**: Basic eigenfrequency synthesis
- **Harmonic**: Musical harmonic series per mode
- **Inharmonic**: Golden ratio frequency relationships
- **FM**: Frequency modulation with eigenvalue ratios
- **Additive**: Rich spectral content shaped by eigenvectors

### 2. **Eigen-Filter: Unprecedented Audio Processing**

**Revolutionary concept:** Instead of conventional EQ or reverb, your audio is processed through the **eigenbasis of your mathematical system**.

**How it works:**
1. Input audio is decomposed onto eigenvector basis functions
2. Each eigenmode acts as a resonant filter
3. Filter characteristics (frequency, Q, gain) determined by eigenvalues
4. Output is reconstruction from filtered modal components

**Why this matters:** This creates **physically coherent** audio transformations where all frequency relationships are mathematically constrained by your chosen system. No arbitrary parameter tweaking - every sonic change reflects genuine mathematical structure.

**Applications:**
- **Cross-synthesis**: Impose the resonant structure of System A onto Audio B
- **Modal cleanup**: Project noisy signals onto stable eigenmodes
- **Timbre transfer**: Mathematical voice changing based on eigenspectrum
- **Coherent processing**: All effects maintain physical relationships

### 3. **Interactive Mathematical Exploration**

**Direct manipulation:** Click matrix elements, eigenvalues, or use physics parameters to sculpt sound in real-time.

**Scientific parameters:**
- **Quantum Uncertainty**: Spectral broadening and noise
- **Gravitational Curvature**: Frequency warping (redshift/blueshift)
- **Coupling Strength**: Modal interaction levels
- **Time Evolution H(t)**: Animated matrix dynamics

### 4. **Phase Transition Detection**

The app automatically detects mathematical **phase transitions** - sudden changes in system behavior that manifest as dramatic sonic shifts. This provides auditory insight into:
- Eigenvalue crossing events
- Stability boundaries
- Bifurcation points
- Critical parameter values
